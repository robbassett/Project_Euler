# My Project Euler Solutions
Solutions to problems posed on projecteuler.net, completed in order of ID number. All solutions completed with python+numpy (and sometimes itertools). I guess this means that not everything is coded from scratch (e.g. itertools.permutations is super helpful in some cases), so sue me!
